## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/WilliamD47/youtubenotification/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```py
def notify(title, message):
    if platform == "darwin":
        t = '-title {!r}'.format(title)
        m = '-message {!r}'.format(message)
        os.system('terminal-notifier {}'.format(' '.join([m, t])))
    elif platform == "win32":
        notification.notify(title, message)
    elif platform == "linux" or platform == "linux2":
        subprocess.Popen(['notify-send', message])
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/WilliamD47/youtubenotification/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
